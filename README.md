    #TODO: add tutorial

## Road-map:

Planned features include:

1. Book: ability to create small books using the notated / transcribed text.

2. Typesetting swarams and sahitya: the ability to typeset swarams and sahitya, so the letters are aligned properly.

3. Transliteration between english, kannada, tamil: just switch language in a dropdown box to get the same content in the chosen language. More languages [telugu, malayalam, devanagari (script), etc.,] can be added: code contribution is always welcome!
