$# More about this editor:

This is a WYSIWYM editor: what you see is what you mean editor.

The text input is a markup language which supports headings, paragraphs and tables. 
The output is a render which looks better than the preview.

Click on download in the top navbar to download the rendered version of this document.

Notice that the chapter title and heading markers are missing from the final output. 
The heading markers instruct the engine to make the line a heading. There are many such symbols and all such instructional symbols will be hidden in the final rendering, leaving only the main content to be read. This reduces clutter. 

The rendered version also has a table of contents, which is automatically generated, and helps you navigate through the document.

$# Aligning content

You can align content using the bar | and pilcrow ⁋ symbols.

Observe the difference between the plain text in the editor, and rendered table in the preview. 
Note how the separators are aligned.

|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ||
|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು (ತ,ದಿ,ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) |

⁋ (ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ಧಿಂ, ⁋
⁋ (ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ಧಿಂ, ⁋
⁋ (ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ⁋

The bar is a separator used to show syllables in a rhythm cycle.
The pilcrow is a separator used to show syllables grouped by structure as opposed to syllables grouped by rhythm cycle.

If you have varying number of columns, then you can simply add an empty line to indicate start of a new table.
Try removing the empty line between the | rows and ⁋ rows in the above example and see what happens.

You can insert a pair of pilcrows by typing // (press slash on your keyboard twice)_ .

Try recreating this example:

⁋ ತಕಝಣು ಧಿಂ, ⁋
⁋ ತಕಝಣು ಧಿಂ, ⁋
⁋ ತಕಝಣು ⁋

1. Place the cursor on the empty line before this line.
2. Press slash on your keyboard twice. It will add two pilcrows and place the cursor in the middle.
3. Click on ತಕಝಣು and ಧಿಂ, in the table to add it to the editor.
4. Copy the content and paste in new lines twice. 
5. Remove the ಧಿಂ, in the third line by pressing backspace.

There is one more separator: the interpunct · : which is a hidden separator - it will be hidden in the render. Compare the following lines with and without the interpunct:

|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ||
|| (ತಾ;ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ತ,ದಿ,ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ | ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿ|ಕಿಟತಕ ತ,ಧಿಂ,ಕಿಟ ತ, ಧಿಂ,ನ್ನ) ||

|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ·ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ·ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ·ತಕಝಣು ||
|| (ತಾ;ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ·ತ,ದಿ,ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ | ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ·ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿ|ಕಿಟತಕ ತ,ಧಿಂ,·ಕಿಟ ತ, ಧಿಂ,ನ್ನ) ||


You can insert an interpunct by pressing tab on your keyboard.
Try recreating this example:

⁋ · ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ⁋
⁋ ತಾಂಕಿಟ · ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ⁋
⁋ ತಾಂಕಿಟ · ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ ⁋

1. Place the cursor on the empty line before this line.
2. Insert two pilcrows by pressing slash twice.
3. Insert an interpunct by pressing tab.
4. Click on ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ in the table to add it, and press End, Enter to go to a new line.
5. Insert two pilcrows and click ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ in the table.
6. Place the cursor before ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ and press tab to insert an interpunct.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 on a new line.

## Clicking to add separators

When you have a lot of text that you want to align, typing the separators by hand becomes tedious. To make it easier, you can type the content and add separators by clicking letters in the preview.

1. Click on a letter in the preview to add an interpunct.
2. Ctrl + Click on a letter in the preview to add a bar.
3. Shift + Click on a letter in the preview to add a pilcrow.

Try recreating this example:

|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು | ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು ||
|| ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು (ತ,ದಿ,ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)

⁋ · (ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ⁋
⁋ (ತಾಂಕಿಟ · ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ⁋
⁋ (ತಾಂಕಿಟ · ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ) ⁋

1. Place the cursor on the empty line before this line.
2. Insert ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು 4 times, press Enter 
2. Insert ತಕದಿಮಿ ತಕಝಣು, type parentheses, and insert ತ,ದಿ,ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ and press Enter twice.

3. Insert parenthesis and ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ and press Enter
4. Insert parenthesis and ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ in two new lines.
5. Click on the letters in the preview to add the separators.

If the alignment seems off, check and add spaces to ensure none of the table cells are empty: every cell must have atleast a space.

You can click on a separator to remove it.

## Aligning columns

The separators work by creating a table, and each separator makes a new column.

You can specify alignment for each column in a table, by specifying [C] and [R] to align center and right respectively. 

|| [L] |[R] | [C] |[R] ||
|| ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ |ತಕಿಟ ||
|| ((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) |((ತಾಂಕಿಟ ದಿಗುತರಿಕಿಟತಕ)) ||

The easiest way to do this is to copy the first line of the table, and replace the content by [C] and [R] where ever you want to align center and right.

Content is aligned left by default.

The alignment will be applied in the render, and the alignment hints will be hidden.

$# Underlines

Everything you put within a (pair of parenthesis) is underlined with (a single underline), unless the matching parenthesis is followed by an underscore.

((This sentence should have two underlines under it));

You can also have (nested parenthesis (like this)) to add a double underline. 

The parenthesis with single/double underlines won't be shown in the render.

Text following an underscore_WillBeShownAsASubScript as long as it does not contain spaces. The underscore will be hidden in the rendering. You can use this to specify varying rhythms.

For example, 

|| (ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ ತಕಿಟ)_3 | (ತಧಿಂ,ಗಿಣತೊಂ)_6 (ತಧಿಂ,ತ(ಕಿಟ)ತೊಂ)_6 ((ತಾಕಿಟತಕ ತೊಂ,ಕಿಟತೊಂ,))_6 (ತಾಕಿಟತಕ ತೊಂ,ಕಿಟತೊಂ,)_12 ||
